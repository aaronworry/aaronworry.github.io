I am looking for PhD position in robotics, and I’m currently a robotic R&D engineer at a startup in Hong Kong Science and Technology Park. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of *[Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/)*. I graduated from Wuhan University with a BSc in ME and a Master degree in Electronical Information in 2019 and 2021 respectively.

My research interests include modeling and computation of dynamical systems, especially in robotics applications such as **multi-robot system** and **soft robots**. Specifically, my research work encompasses the following key aspects: 1) Designing **simulation** environment to represent the differential equations and state-transition. 2) Combined with sensor data, developing algorithms including **optimization** and **data-driven methods** to solve the problem. 3) Deploying these algorithms on real robots, enabling precise control to accomplish various tasks. Presently, my focus lies in motion simulation for soft robot, as well as state estimation of objects where there are interactions with compliant materials.
