I am looking for PhD position in robotics, and Iâ€™m currently a robotic R&D engineer at a startup in Hong Kong Science and Technology Park. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of *[Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/)*. I graduated from Wuhan University with a BSc in ME and a Master degree in Electronical Information in 2019 and 2021 respectively.

My research interests lie in the robotics, including **modelling**, **planning** and **control**, and **multi-robot system**. I focus on deploying robots in unstructured environments, especially in some occasion where human beings are hard to access and work. Moreover, I am passionate about exploring how things naturally work, using mathematical proofs or physical models to describe and explain how robots work in scenarios.
